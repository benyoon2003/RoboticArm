# RoboticArm
While the De1-SoC has several configurable hardware systems on its own board, the processor may be used as an intermediary interface between a Linux-based operating system and other electronic devices. We employed the De1-SoC board to write to a robotic arm. This robotic arm was simply a configuration of 5 servo motors. Although these motors may still be controlled using the same RegisterWrite() function used for the LED lights and 7-segment displays on the De1-SoC, they operate using a PWM signal, meaning that an alternating signal of 1’s and 0’s must be sent using specific intervals. This alternating signal controls the positioning of each servo motor in the robotic arm system, allowing the user to control specific directions of movement and locations within a 180° spectrum of angles. 
We utilized this PWM concept to control each individual servo on the robotic arm. This demanded a generalized knowledge of how PWM signals work and how they may be written to devices by writing 1’s and 0’s to the register in specified segments of time.
